# pathfinding

DEMO: https://r4z396.github.io/A-Pathfinding-Algorithm/

Demonstration of the algorithm to find the shortest path.
Algorithm: A*. 

Implemented Mechanics:

-Posibility of creation of two diferent types of maps complete customized random.

-A* Algorithm implemented and functional.

-Walkable and non walkable blocks

-Different heights

-Different cost in vertical and horizontal movement

-The cost of raising a level or lowering is more expensive than advancing at the same height
